## Tech-Stack

This project is a sophisticated chatbot designed to enhance the Amazon shopping experience. It employs a range of technologies to deliver a seamless and interactive user interface:

1. Scrapy : Utilized for web scraping, it fetches real-time product information from Amazon, including product details and pricing.
  
2. Wit.ai : Powers the chatbot's natural language understanding. Intents are trained to recognize user queries and respond appropriately, such as suggesting products.

3. HTML, CSS, JavaScript : The frontend is crafted using standard web technologies. Each product suggestion is displayed as a card with options to "Show Product" or "Add to Cart."

4. Flask: Serves as the backend framework, integrating the Scrapy spider and Wit.ai bot with the frontend, and handling user interactions.

5. Amazon EC2 : The entire application is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, ensuring scalability and robust performance.

## Future Scope


As we look ahead, there are several exciting directions in which this chatbot can evolve to further enhance the user experience:

1. Virtual Try-On: Integration of Augmented Reality (AR) to allow users to virtually try on attire such as shoes, watches, glasses, and clothes, providing a more interactive shopping experience is being made. Few reference papers on which we are working are as follows:

* GP-VITON : https://github.com/xiezhy6/GP-VTON

2. Amazon API: When fully integrated with Amazon, the use of Amazon's native API could significantly reduce the time required for search queries, making the bot more efficient.

3. Cart Management: A feature could be added to allow users to view all the items in their Amazon cart directly within the chat interface, streamlining the shopping process.

4. Multilingual Support: To cater to a global audience, the chatbot could be developed to support multiple languages, making it accessible to non-EnglishÂ speakers.
